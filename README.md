# 🌿 Nourish

Nourish is an innovative application aimed at connecting community members in Philadelphia with nearby community fridges. Our mission is to promote communal food sharing and ensure convenient access to essential food resources.

## 📖 Description

Nourish allows users to easily locate community fridges throughout Philadelphia. The app also includes a community board, where members can sign up to share updates about fridge restocking, express community needs or offers, and report on any maintenance required. This project is committed to fostering a sense of community and supporting local food security initiatives.

## Key Features

1. **Interactive Map**: A user-friendly interactive map displaying community fridges in the Philadelphia area. Users can explore fridges near them and search for fridges by zip code.

2. **Fridge Locations Page**: This page provides a comprehensive view of all the community fridges in Philadelphia. It includes a dropdown menu that allows users to filter fridges by zip code.

3. **Detailed Fridge Information**: By clicking on "Learn More" for individual fridges, users can access detailed information about each fridge. This includes social media links, the address, and information on how to volunteer.

4. **Community Board**: A dynamic space where members can post about restockings, express needs or offers related to the fridges and the community, and report if any fridges need maintenance.
